# BONEKIFY

Bonekify is a music streaming web application service similar to Spotify.

Users are able to search and listen to a variety of songs. Surfing and exploring new songs is a breeze as Bonekify has displays for song/album information and list. Bonekify features a song management system for admins to add, change, and delete songs/albums. Admins are also able to see the list of users using the service. Users can also listen to premium songs feature. To do so, users can subscribe to the premium singers first which then will be validated by admin from the Binotify Premium App.
